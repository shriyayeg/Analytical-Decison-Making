This notebook focuses on building and evaluating logistic regression models, alongside optimization exercises. Below is a breakdown of the key sections.

## 1. Introduction and Imports
The notebook begins by importing necessary libraries:
- **Pandas** for data manipulation.
- **NumPy** for numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** for plotting.
- **Statsmodels** for building statistical models, especially logistic regression.

## 2. Exercise 1: Operations Excellence
This exercise deals with setting up optimization models for operational efficiency. It involves:

### Optimization Model
- **Decision Variables:** Define production quantities (e.g., units produced at different sites).
- **Objective Function:** Formulated to maximize profit or minimize cost.
- **Constraints:** Ensure limitations like raw materials, processing capacities, and non-negativity constraints are met.

---

## 3. Exercise 2: Logistic Regression
This exercise focuses on estimating logistic regression models and evaluating their performance using the dataset.

### Data Preparation
The data is loaded and preprocessed. Steps include:
- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Scaling features for model input.

### Model Estimation
Using `Logit` from the **statsmodels** library, the logistic regression model is estimated. The model fits on the prepared dataset, and a detailed summary of the model's coefficients and performance is displayed.

## 4. Performance Metrics
Key metrics used to evaluate the logistic regression model:
- **Accuracy:** Proportion of correct predictions.
- **Precision:** Proportion of correctly predicted positives.
- **Recall:** Proportion of actual positives correctly identified.
- **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful for imbalanced datasets.

These metrics are computed to assess the effectiveness of the logistic regression model and its ability to predict the outcomes accurately.

## 5. Conclusion
The notebook showcases a complete process, from data preparation and optimization modeling to the estimation and evaluation of logistic regression. It demonstrates a practical approach to solving business problems using Python's statistical and machine learning libraries.
